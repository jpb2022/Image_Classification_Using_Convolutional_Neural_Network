# Image_Classification_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Network
Loaded CIFAR-10 data (60k images, 10 classes) from TensorFlow. Split: 50k training, 10k testing. Data normalized. ANN: ReLU in hidden, softmax in output. Trained 5 epochs, accuracy 49%. Transitioned to CNN: conv, max-pooling, ReLU. Trained 10 epochs, accuracy 70%. CNN excelled, extracted image features for better performance.
